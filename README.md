## Usage

This project is designed for extracting and processing data to enhance its quality for AI applications. It includes a series of scripts and utilities aimed at cleaning, organizing, and preparing datasets for machine learning and data analysis tasks.

## Local Installation

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   - Type `python3 -m venv .venv` to create a virtual environment named `.venv`. You can replace `.venv` with any name you prefer for your virtual environment.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - To activate the virtual environment, use the command `source .venv/bin/activate`. You should see the name of the virtual environment (`.venv`) appear in your command prompt, indicating that the environment is active.

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Ensure your `requirements.txt` file is in the same directory.
   - Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. **Execute the Script**:

   - Now that the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can run your script with the command `python src/test.py`.

5. **Exit the Virtual Environment**:
   - Once you are done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by typing `deactivate` in the terminal.

Here is a summary of commands to execute:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/test.py
deactivate
```
